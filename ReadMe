# ProjectionsDatabase 
The State and Local Population Projections Database brings together population projection information and materials 
from different sources through survey response and resource sharing. The database can be used by population projection 
developers and researchers for the study and analysis of population projection methods, and associated uncertainty. 
Historical as well as current population projections are included in the database, it includes a mix of sources and 
methods, and it can be added to over time. The design of the database is United States-focused, but projections from 
other countries can be added too. The database is for independent analysis of population projections, and is not 
authoritative for any of the included works. Database items are hosted primarily on Google Drive, and backed up 
periodically, and the webpage and supporting content for the database are hosted on GitHub.
